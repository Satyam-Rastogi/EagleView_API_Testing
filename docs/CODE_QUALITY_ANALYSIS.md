# Code Quality Analysis

## Overall Assessment
The codebase demonstrates good structure and follows reasonable Python practices, but has several areas for improvement in terms of maintainability and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

## Major Redundancies

### 1. Hardcoded Credentials
**Issue**: Client credentials are hardcoded in multiple files:
- `fetch_reports_client_credentials.py`
- `fetch_images_client_credentials.py`
- `download_images.py`
- `test_custom_locations.py`
- `test_address_requests.py`
- `test_additional_data.py`

**Impact**: Security risk and maintenance burden - changing credentials requires updates in 6+ files.

### 2. Duplicate Configuration Code
**Issue**: Each script contains identical configuration blocks:
```python
config = EagleViewConfig(
    client_id="0oa16yo11pa57TLPa2p8",
    client_secret="BAfJ05yNlGaNt8Gm3gnO_0ekJ1DRlwJsaNgU4aePS9o5iCuxyOuZL1kmxxHionD7",
    requests_per_second=3,
    requests_per_minute=50,
    is_sandbox=True
)
```

**Impact**: Code duplication makes it difficult to maintain consistent configuration across the project.

### 3. Repeated Client Initialization
**Issue**: Each script independently creates a client instance:
```python
client = ClientCredentialsEagleViewClient(config)
```

**Impact**: Redundant initialization code scattered across multiple files.

### 4. Duplicate Logging Setup
**Issue**: Similar logging configurations in multiple files with only filename differences.

## Code Quality Issues

### 1. Error Handling Inconsistencies
- Some scripts have comprehensive error handling
- Others have minimal or no error handling
- Inconsistent logging levels and messages

### 2. File Path Dependencies
- Hardcoded file paths like `'property_data_result_dce2f233-b84a-4b0d-880b-1bded5ede99a.json'`
- Scripts depend on specific output files from previous runs
- No fallback mechanisms for missing files

### 3. Magic Numbers and Strings
- Hardcoded rate limits (3 requests/second, 50 requests/minute)
- Fixed image download limits (e.g., `[:3]` in download scripts)
- Hardcoded sandbox bounding box coordinates in comments

## Positive Aspects

### 1. Good Separation of Concerns
- Main client library is well-structured
- Individual scripts focus on specific tasks
- Clear method naming and documentation

### 2. Proper Error Handling in Core Library
- ClientCredentialsEagleViewClient has robust error handling
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Token refresh mechanisms

### 3. Logging Implementation
- Good use of logging throughout the application
- Multiple output handlers (file and console)

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Create Configuration Module
Create a `config.py` file to centralize credentials and settings:
```python
# config.py
CLIENT_ID = "your_client_id"
CLIENT_SECRET = "your_client_secret"
REQUESTS_PER_SECOND = 3
REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 50
IS_SANDBOX = True
```

### 2. Create Utility Functions
Create a `utils.py` file for common operations:
```python
# utils.py
def create_client():
    """Create and return configured EagleView client"""
    config = EagleViewConfig(
        client_id=CLIENT_ID,
        client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
        requests_per_second=REQUESTS_PER_SECOND,
        requests_per_minute=REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE,
        is_sandbox=IS_SANDBOX
    )
    return ClientCredentialsEagleViewClient(config)
```

### 3. Implement Configuration Management
- Use environment variables or config files for credentials
- Allow command-line arguments for configuration overrides
- Add validation for required parameters

### 4. Improve Error Handling Consistency
- Standardize error handling patterns across all scripts
- Create custom exceptions for common error scenarios
- Implement retry mechanisms where appropriate

### 5. Add File Management Utilities
- Create functions to find the most recent data files
- Implement fallback mechanisms for missing dependencies
- Add file validation before processing

## Summary
The codebase is functional but has significant redundancy issues, particularly with hardcoded credentials and duplicate configuration code. The core client library is well-designed, but the individual scripts could benefit from refactoring to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
