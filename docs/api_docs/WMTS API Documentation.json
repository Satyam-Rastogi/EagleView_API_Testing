This base path is specified before the endpoint path.\n- **The endpoint path.** For example, `/imagery/wmts/v1/visual/capabilities.xml`.\n- **Required parameters.** These parameters must be included in a request.\n- **Optional parameters.** These parameters can be included in a request if desired.\n\n## Sandbox\n\nThe WMTS API can be tested in sandbox mode. The sandbox testing area is limited to the following bounding box, which covers approximately 1.5 square miles in Omaha, Nebraska:\n\n```\n-96.00532698173473, 41.24140396772262, -95.97589954958912, 41.25672882015283\n```\n\nRefer to the [WMTS API User Guides](https://developer.eagleview.com/documentation/wmts/v1/guides/getting-started) for a Postman collection which contains a number of sample requests.\n\n# Authentication\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->","version":"v1"},"servers":[{"url":"https://apis.eagleview.com"}],"paths":{"/imagery/wmts/v1/visual/tile/{layer}/default/{tile_matrix_set}/{z}/{x}/{y}.{format}":{"get":{"tags":["GetTile"],"summary":"Retrieve a visual tile","description":"Returns a 256x256 slippy-map aligned visual tile.","operationId":"GET /imagery/wmts/v1/visual/tile/*","parameters":[{"name":"layer","in":"path","required":true,"description":"The layer to fetch the tile for, obtained from the GetCapabilities response (e.g. `Latest`, `LatestBestResolution` or `<a valid image urn>`).","schema":{"type":"string"},"x-position":1,"example":"Latest"},{"name":"tile_matrix_set","in":"path","required":true,"description":"The tile matrix set that is associated with the layer, obtained from the GetCapabilities response.","schema":{"type":"string","nullable":true},"x-position":2,"example":"GoogleMapsCompatible_9-23"},{"name":"z","in":"path","required":true,"description":"The tile zoom level, as per the [Slippy Map Tilenames](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames) specification.","schema":{"type":"integer"},"x-position":3,"example":20},{"name":"x","in":"path","required":true,"description":"The tile column, as per the [Slippy Map Tilenames](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames) specification.","schema":{"type":"integer"},"x-position":4,"example":286671},{"name":"y","in":"path","required":true,"description":"The tile row, as per the [Slippy Map Tilenames](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames) specification.","schema":{"type":"integer"},"x-position":5,"example":437890},{"name":"format","in":"path","required":true,"description":"The image format of the returned tile:\n* `jpeg`: quality can be adjusted via the `quality` query parameter, defaults to lossy 75% quality jpeg without alpha (smaller file size, recommended)\n* `png`: lossless png with alpha (larger file size)","schema":{"type":"string","nullable":true},"x-position":6,"example":"jpeg"},{"name":"quality","in":"query","description":"Optionally specify the quality of JPEG tiles based on compression/bandwidth requirements.
